# Word lists
adjectives = ["Epic", "Smart", "Brave", "Silent", "Bright", "Swift", "Lucky", "Magic"]
nouns = ["Tiger", "Rocket", "Ocean", "Storm", "River", "Forest", "Eagle", "Flame"]

# Generator function
def generate_brand_name():
    adjective = random.choice(adjectives)
    noun = random.choice(nouns)
    return adjective + noun

# Generate and print 5 brand names
for _ in range(5):
    print(generate_brand_name())
```
